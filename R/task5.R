# This is a test file from a class I have this semester
#We are adopting two populations of nematodes and running plate counts daily
#Ultimately, I'd like to continually update this file to Github as well as...
#....playing with ggplot as the data evolves and discovering the quirks of the system!
# You're going to see a LOT of this file...
